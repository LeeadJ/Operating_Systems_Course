# st_pipeline

This repository contains an implementation of a multi-threaded pipeline using active objects and a queue. The pipeline processes a series of numbers, performs calculations, and checks for prime numbers in a parallel manner.

## Overview

The pipeline consists of four stages, each implemented as an Active Object (AO) with specific responsibilities. The stages are as follows:

1. **Stage A: Prime Number Checking**
   - File: `is_prime.h`, `is_prime.c`
   - This stage provides a function `isPrime` that checks whether a given unsigned integer is a prime number.
   - The function returns `true` if the number is prime and `false` otherwise.

2. **Stage B: Multi-Threaded Queue**
   - Files: `queue.h`, `queue.c`
   - This stage implements a multi-threaded queue with Mutex lock protection.
   - The queue is designed to hold `void*` elements and allows waiting for a member without busy waiting, utilizing condition variables for synchronization.

3. **Stage C: Active Object Implementation**
   - Files: `activeObject.h`, `activeObject.c`
   - This stage provides an implementation of an Active Object (AO) with the following functions:
     - `CreateActiveObject`: Binds and runs an active object thread. The function selects a queue and receives a pointer to the function that will be called for each element in the queue.
     - `getQueue`: Returns a pointer to the queue of the active object. This function can be used to insert a member into the queue.
     - `stop`: Stops the active object and releases all memory structures of the object.

4. **Stage D: Pipeline Tasks**
   - Files: `st_pipeline.h`, `st_pipeline.c`
   - This stage orchestrates the pipeline tasks and sets up the active objects.
   - The pipeline performs a series of calculations and checks on the input numbers and displays the results.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.

2. Compile the code using the provided makefile by running the following command in the terminal: `make`

3. Run the compiled program by executing the following command:
    - ./st_pipeline <num_tasks> [seed]
    - `<num_tasks>`: The number of tasks to be processed in the pipeline.
    - `[seed]` (optional): The seed value for random number generation. If not provided, a default seed will be used.

4. The program will execute the pipeline tasks and display the output.

## Pipeline Description

The pipeline performs a series of calculations and prime number checks on the input numbers. It consists of four stages executed in parallel:

1. **Stage A: Random Number Generation**
- The first active object generates `N` random six-digit numbers using the provided seed value (or a default seed if not provided).
- Each generated number is transferred to the next active object with a time delay of one thousandth of a second.

2. **Stage B: Print and Add 11**
- The second active object receives a number from the previous stage and performs the following tasks:
  - Prints the received number.
  - Checks if the number is prime using the `isPrime` function.
  - Prints `true` if the number is prime, or `false` otherwise.
  - Adds 11 to the number and transfers it to the next active object.

3. **Stage C: Print and Subtract 13**
- The third active object receives a number from the previous stage and performs the following tasks:
  - Prints the received number.
  - Checks if the number is prime using the `isPrime` function.
  - Prints `true` if the number is prime, or `false` otherwise.
  - Subtracts 13 from the number and transfers it to the next active object.

4. **Stage D: Print and Add 2**
- The fourth active object receives a number from the previous stage and performs the following tasks:
  - Prints the received number.
  - Adds 2 to the number and prints the new number.
  - Transfers the number back to the first active object in a cyclic manner.
  - The last number printed should be equal to the first number generated if implemented correctly.

## Dependencies

The code requires a C compiler, the pthread library for thread synchronization, and the math library for the `sqrt` function.

## Running Example

To demonstrate the functionality of the program, let's consider an example execution with two tasks.
